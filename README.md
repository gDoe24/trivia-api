# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Create your own trivia game for you or your team/friends to play complete with categories, custom questions, and an interactive interface. Use endpoints to add/delete questions and filter questions for specific categories. Play a game of trivia by connecting the front end.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

Follow the README.md in the frontend folder to follow instructions on setting up the react environment.

[`./frontend/`](./frontend/README.md)

### Backend Setup

Follow the README.md in the backend folder to follow instructions on setting up the local environment along with project endpoints.

[`./backend/`](./backend/README.md)



We recommend following the instructions in those files in order. This order will look familiar from our prior work in the course.

## Starting and Submitting the Project

[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the [project repository]() and [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) your forked repository to your machine. Work on the project locally and make sure to push all your changes to the remote repository before submitting the link to your repository in the Classroom. 

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. You will work primarily in app.py to define your endpoints and can reference models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup. 

### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will need to update the endpoints after you define them in the backend. Those areas are marked with TODO and can be searched for expediency. 

Pay special attention to what data the frontend is expecting from each API response to help guide how you format your API.
