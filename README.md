# Full Stack API Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Create your own trivia game for you or your team/friends to play complete with categories, custom questions, and an interactive interface. Use endpoints to add/delete questions and filter questions for specific categories. Play a game of trivia by connecting the front end.
